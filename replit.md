# Overview

This is a comprehensive snack bar management system built in Python with a Tkinter GUI. The system provides complete control over inventory management, sales recording, data export, and visualization capabilities. It's designed as a standalone desktop application that uses SQLite for local data storage and offers features like stock control, sales history tracking, Excel exports, and interactive charts.

# User Preferences

Preferred communication style: Simple, everyday language.
System requirements: Executable (.exe) with future update capabilities, pricing system integration, comprehensive stock management.
Build issues: Nuitka download failures resolved with PyInstaller alternative and .bat execution scripts.
Priority: System must work immediately in real lanchonete environment.
Documentation: Complete technical documentation created for maintenance and future modifications.
Knowledge transfer: User needs detailed explanations to understand Python architecture for independent maintenance.
Financial Dashboard: Complete financial dashboard implemented with 8 metrics, 4 chart types, intelligent alerts, and Excel export capabilities (August 2025).
Training Manual: Comprehensive training manual created for optimal system usage, covering all features, daily workflows, best practices, and troubleshooting (August 2025).
Commercial Focus: User interested in real commercial viability and practical implementation. System must be production-ready for actual lanchonete businesses with realistic pricing and market analysis.
Database Issues Resolved: Fixed "no such column id" and "NOT NULL constraint failed" errors through database structure unification and automatic migration system (August 2025).
Universal Accessibility: System optimized for users from children to elderly with comprehensive keyboard shortcuts (F1-F10, Enter, ESC), large fonts (22pt titles, 14pt fields, 28pt totals), high contrast colors, oversized buttons, audio feedback, and intelligent navigation. Complete auto-installer .bat files created for automatic Python download and installation (August 2025).
